Currently, I am an associate scientist in the Genome Informatics Facility at Iowa State University, working with a group of amazing people. Here, I work on a multitude of projects, including a continuation of my previous research. Some of these projects involve:  characterizing the genomes of endangered abalone species, assessing the cellular roles of small RNAs in nematodes, creating user-friendly bioinformatics tutorials, assessing transposition in irradiated maize, trans-splicing in nematodes, etc.  With the huge variation of collaborative projects that come into the Genome Informatics Facility, the constant influx of novel ideas creates an environment conducive to my development as a contributing member of the scientific community.

My main interests are in the fields of bioinformatics and evolutionary genomics. Currently, I am working on various projects involving next-generation sequencing including the first de novo assembly of a teosinte genome. I am also developing pipelines to streamline the assembly and annotation process for newly sequenced organisms. My long-term goal is to study the genome organization and evolution of grass species.
