# Introduction to Experimental Design

Bioinformatics and data analysis starts with a good experimental design.  In this section we will explore the aspects of experimental design that are important to a successful bioinformatic data analysis.

## Learning Objective
Upon completion of this section on experimental design the learner will be able to:

* Assess the assumptions and limitations of the biological domain and the sequencing technology as it relates to a biology question of interest
* Evaluate which sequencing technology will provide the best results for a given project
* Determine the limitations that result from reducing the amount of data collected in order to fit within a given budget.
