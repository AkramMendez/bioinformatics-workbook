# Sex Determination in a Fish

#### Background
Aquaculture production has become increasingly important to satisfy seafood and fishery product demands. Researcher wants to develop genomic resources to improve sustainable domestic aquaculture.  They recently assembled and annotated a genome and now want to collect wild fish to explore genetic diversity in local populations and identify the sex determining region.
