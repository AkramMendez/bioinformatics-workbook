### 3. Contributing to sections of the published methods

We understand that in Bioinormatics there is more than one way to do things. It is especially true selcting a particular method might
infulence the final outcome (results). Hence, we encourage you to add alternative methods for the exisiting workflows that you think might be 
more suitable (for particular organism or under particular circumstances). Please follow the exisiting conventions and explain it why they
should be using other mehtods instead.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to bininformatics-workbook](https://github.com/ISUgenomics/bioinformatics-workbook/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our writing conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Writing conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * Self promotion is not allowed, unless you're Heng Li!
  * Use best practices whenever possible. There might be many ways to do things, but the goal here is to make it smooth for beginners without being very confusing. 
  * So that we can consistently find the images for each chapter in a known location, images should be saved in the `assets` folder of the section for whcih the chapter belongs to. 
  * Methods should be generalized, but we also encourage public data as exaple for running tutorial methods.
