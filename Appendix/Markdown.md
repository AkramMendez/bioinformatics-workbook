# Markdown
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a text-based mark-up language that is easily rendered
into HTML

--

* It has become a staple of reproducible science:

--

    * it can be rendered on GitHub (also Bitbucket & GitLab) and makes online repositories more readable and accessible
--

    * it is used as a notebook interface for R ([Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/))
--

    * it is used as the markup language for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks, which provide a notebook interface for many languages, including Python and R
--

* There are some freely available editors that make writing in Markdown pretty easy

    * Windows and Linux: [Github ATOM](https://atom.io/) and [REMARKABLE](https://remarkableapp.github.io/)
    * Mac OSX: [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/)

--

* I made all my slides using Markdown and a HTML template called [Remark](https://remarkjs.com)

# Markdown

## Let's see some Markdown

* It is recommended that all README files on web-based Git hosts be written using Markdown

--

* The file extension for a Markdown file is `.md`

--

* I will demonstrate in MacDown with our `README.md` file for `Week_03`
