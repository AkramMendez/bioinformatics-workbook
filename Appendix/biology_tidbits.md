# List of Biology exceptions and irregularities

## Organism related
1. **Egg laying mammal:** Mammals nurture their young ones with their specialized glands that produce milk. But, Platypus is one of the exception that lays eggs. They belong to the order `monotremata` and there are 5 living sppecies that are all indegenious to Australia and New Guinea.
2. **Fish with lungs:** Fish normally breathe by taking in water by mouth, passing them through thin lines of cells and expelling water out through gills (openings on side of the body). But, some fish (Lungfish), do have lungs that they use to breathe, like amphibians, that lets them breathe out of water!

## Cell related

1. **Exon/intron gene structure**: is the property of _eukaryotes_, however yeasts, which are unicellular _eukaryotes_, do not have any introns in them (mostly mono-exonic genes). Similarly, several species of cynobacteria, &#947; subdivision of purple bacteria (proteobacteria) have been identified, that do have [self splicing introns](https://www.nature.com/articles/364358a0) in them.
2. **Star codons**: `AUG` is considered as universal start codon, which codes for the first amino-acid (methionine) of the translated product. However, the universal start codon is not _universal_ at all! It has been [shown that](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12619-6) other variations of this codon (`NUG`) is more frequently used in various organisms as a start codon.
