1. **Egg laying mammal:** Mammals nurture their young ones with their specialized glands that produce milk. But, Platypus is one of the exception that lays eggs. They belong to the order `monotremata` and there are 5 living sppecies that are all indegenious to Australia and New Guinea.

1. **Exon/intron gene structure**: is the property of _eukaryotes_, however yeasts, which are unicellular _eukaryotes_, do not have any introns in them (mostly mono-exonic genes). Similarly, several species of cynobacteria, &#947; subdivision of purple bacteria (proteobacteria) have been identified, that do have [self splicing introns](https://www.nature.com/articles/364358a0) in them.
2. **Star codons**: `AUG` is considered as universal start codon, which codes for the first amino-acid (methionine) of the translated product. However, the universal start codon is not _universal_ at all! It has been [shown that](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12619-6) other variations of this codon (`NUG`) is more frequently used in various organisms as a start codon.
