- RNA-Seq Analysis (intro)
 - Arabidopsis with a genome
   - Which genes are significant?
 - Arabidopsis without a genome
   - Which genes are significant?
 - Comparison of Arabidopsis with and without a genome.
   - How are the results different?
     - Venn diagram of significant genes.
   - How are they the same?
 - Example 2
 - Example 3
- Genome Assembly
 - introduction to Genome assembly
  - List of assembly programs
  - How to pick a genome assembly programs
   - Assumptions and limitations of domain and data.





## visualization

- Introduction to R
- Introduction to iPython
- Introduction to Cytoscape

## Appendix
- Introduction to Unix and Terminals
- Comprehensive File format descriptions (review of formats as introduced in text.)




## Book Format options

- Choose your own adventure series.  Create a storyline that requires the users to solve problems (real world) using sequencing data.  Hospital outbreak, Ebola virus spread, etc.  
 - Would need them to somehow make choices that would lead them down different paths.
