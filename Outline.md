# Ideas to implement or to icebox but get out of your head.

## Introduction

## Experimental Design
- This section could be skipped if they want to start working right away
- Need examples

## Data Acquisition
- start with how to download our example data. (wget? already on bridges and ceres?)
- Review of file formats -> point to appendix
- Where to find data? fastq, fasta, genome, etc
- scp
- Rsync
- wget
- globus
- downloading from sra and iplant

## Data wrangling
- Review of fasta/fastq file format
- Problems and solutions
 - fastq -> fasta
 - fastq quality trimming
## Data Analysis
- Needs an Introduction


## visualization

- Introduction to R
- Introduction to iPython
- Introduction to Cytoscape

## Appendix
- Introduction to Unix and Terminals
- Comprehensive File format descriptions (review of formats as introduced in text.)




## Book Format options

- Choose your own adventure series.  Create a storyline that requires the users to solve problems (real world) using sequencing data.  Hospital outbreak, Ebola virus spread, etc.  
 - Would need them to somehow make choices that would lead them down different paths.
