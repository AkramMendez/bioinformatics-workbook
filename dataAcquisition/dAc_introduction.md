# Introduction to Data Acquisition

## What is Data Acquisition?

Data acquisition is how data is obtained through the process of downloading or transfering files from one location to another. In this section of the bioinformatics workbook, we will discuss the unix commands used to transfer/download data and also the web repositories to which data is deposited and from which data can be downloaded.

## What dataset will we use throughout this text?

As much as possible, we will be using Arabidopsis data from multiple NCBI BioProject that contains datasets for many of the most common data analyses.  The following BioProjects were chosen.

#### Why Arabidopsis?
Arabidopsis is one of several model organisms where significant amounts of data has been collected on a wide variety of bioinformatic data analysis problems.  Additional example datasets from a variety of organism will also be provided as problem sets to explore.
