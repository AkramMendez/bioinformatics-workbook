# Introduction to Bioinformatics

## Preface
The best way to learn bioinformatics is through examples of real world problems.  The Bioinformatics Workbook provides the reader with an in depth understanding of experimental design, data acquisition, data wrangling, data analysis and visualization.  This is accomplished through worked out example problem in each of these sections along with one or more advanced problem sets and corresponding solutions.

## What is Bioinformatics?
Bioinformatics is the study of biology using
information.  It involves the acquisition, storing, processing and visualizing  of biological data. The most common form of biological data is generated from high throughput sequencing machines that are produced by companies such as Illumina, Pacbio and Nanopore.  However, biological data involves so much more beyond genomics.  Some common other biological data types include data from proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics and lipidomics.  It also includes the metadata of the sample: tissue type, location collected, time collected and phenotype.
