# Introduction to Project Management

Project management is defined as the process of keeping track of the many aspects of a project from experimental design through publication.

  * Folders and Files
  * Communication and Discussion
  * Notebook of commands and related code

The overall goal of a solid project management process is the ability for a new person to join a project and be able to reproduce everything that has gone before and carry the project forward.

* Reproducibility
* Locations
* Date
* Size





Example use cases

* A grant was funded
* preliminary data generation for a grant proposal
*


## Learning Objectives

* Introduction to Slack
* Introduction to GitHub

# Introduction to using a github repo as an online notebook

The main points in reproducibility is for someone that has not worked on the project to know exactly what you did, when you did it, where you did it and the version you used.  This can be accomplished relatively easily by following these guidelines.

- Set up a folder on the computer or super computer that you will be analyzing your data.
- Create subfolders for each analysis step with a number associated with each folder starting at 00_.  This will allow someone to be able to follow the steps you took from the folder structure (examples below)
  - 00_rawData
  - 01_DataQC
  - 01_alignmentAndCounting
  - 02_RNA-SeqDE
- Create a corresponding Mark down file in this github repository that corresponds to the work found in each folder.
- For every step you make record it in this mark down folder along with
  - title
  - date
  - Computername and path of working directory
