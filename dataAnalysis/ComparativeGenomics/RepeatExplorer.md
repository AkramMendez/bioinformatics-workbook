Repeat Explorer is a graph-based clustering algorithm that uses unassembled short reads to identify repeat families from low depth genomic sequencing.  Documentation can be found [here](http://repeatexplorer.org/?page_id=818).

This tutorial runs sequence reads through the preprocessing steps necessary to run repeatExplorer.
