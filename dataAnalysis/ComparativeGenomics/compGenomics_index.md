# Comparative Genomics Introduction

In [comparative genomics](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/comparative-genomics-13239404) the genome sequence of different species are compared. This helps scientists to study the differences between life forms at the molecular level. Additionally identifying the conserved genes as well as the genes that gives each organism its unique character, is a powerful tool in studying evolution.

In this section we will be calling orthologous genes between two sets of genes and identifying genes that are significantly associated with a feature or characteristic of a transcriptome/genome. We will also introduce softwares that facilitate phylostratigraphic analysis.
