# Bioinformatics Workbook:

The best way to learn bioinformatics is through examples of real world problems.  The Bioinformatics Workbook provides the reader with an in depth understanding of experimental design, data acquisition, data wrangling, data analysis and visualization.  This is accomplished through worked out example problem in each of these sections along with one or more advanced problem sets and corresponding solutions.
